# Notes on deployments

This directory pertains strictly to Github-managed deployments on servers. It is not related to the application chart.

To execute this job, you must manually choose the `Linode Deployment` job from Github Actions; it will not execute otherwise. Check [the deploy-linode GH workflow](../.github/workflows/deploy-linode.yml) to see the full deployment manifest.

Note that we do NOT publish this directory's Helm chart to a repository, we simply use it on the command-line.

## Secrets

These are stored as Github secrets.

- `LINODE_B64_KUBECONFIG` - base64-encoded Kubeconfig for the Kubernetes cluster
- `LINODE_B64_SECRET_VALUES` - base64-encoded secret values we apply additionally to the deployment


### Secrets values yaml file

To update `LINODE_B64_SECRET_VALUES`, use `examples.secrets-values.yaml` as a template for new yaml (say `new-secrets.yaml`) and...
  1. Update the passwords secrets where `CHANGEME` occurs
    - To create random, you can use: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe())"`
  2. Base64 encode the yaml file: `base64 new-secret.yaml`
  3. Update the GitHub Actions `LINODE_B64_SECRET_VALUES` with this encoded string from step (2):

  4. Save changes!
